# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project to classify movie reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using natural language processing techniques.

## 🧠 Project Summary
This project uses a dataset of movie reviews and applies text preprocessing and classification techniques to analyze sentiment. It explores the use of TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression for NLP-based sentiment classification.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📊 Key Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
- Data visualization of model performance

## 📈 Results
- The model achieved solid accuracy and correctly classified reviews into 3 sentiment categories.
